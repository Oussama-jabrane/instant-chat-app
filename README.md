# What's the project about?

The project "instant-chat-app" is a React.js-Vite project that let you chat with everyone registered in the website and make new friends and connections around the world.

# Author of the website

I am Oussama Jabrane, a Sichuan University Software Engineering freshman who's passionate about coding and making new stuff. I hope one day I can land my dream job at my dream tech company.

# Tech stack used in the website

In this website, I used React.js and tailwind.css in the frontend. And Firebase in the backend, server and deployment

# How to run the code on localhost?

First, you need to download the code on your local machine, by running this command:
> git clone <https://github.com/Oussama-jabrane/instant-chat-app.git>

And then cd into the project by running the following command:
> cd instant-chat-app

And, now the first step is done. Next, you should install all the dependencies of the app by running this command (And make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine):
> npm install

Then, all the dependencies will be installed. Create a new Firebase project and copy all the keys of your account into an .env file in the root directory, after that you can finally run the command:
> npm start

And BOOM, the website is running and fully-functionning.

# What about the deployed website?

Here is the [deployed website](https://instant-chat-app1.web.app) if you want a demo of the project.
